# IoTHubAMQP
This project is a demo for working with Azure IoT Hub in .NET 3.5 based applications.
In case of Azure API, it is supported only from .NET4.5 or later, and there is an issue to upgrade application platform in case of existing legacy application. In this case, this demonstration can be used with the Azure IoT Hub in legacy applications.
